# Mulivariable Nonlinear Control Uni2024

Enclosed are the final versions of code generated in order to complete the Multivariable Nonlinear Control module as part of MEng Engineering Design 2024/25.

This was a 3 month project in order to program a 2 link robot arm that draws circles, triangles and squares.

You can find videos of Sonia (the robot) as well as a copy of the final report in Documentation folder.

The work is a combination of C code (for the Raspberry Pi microcontroller), Python (reference signal generation), and MATLAB/SIMULINK (MIMO controller simulation).
