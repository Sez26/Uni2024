# You Can Download and Run this Notebook!

TuneThoseGains.ipynb is an ipython notebook, you can download it, modify it to suit your system and run it locally to calculate gains for your state space controller!

## Install

To run this notebook you'll need to install Jupyter Notebooks and the easiest way to handle the dependencies is to set up a conda environment. To install Jupyter and conda, download Anaconda from [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).

## Create and Activate the Environment

To make sure all the dependencies are met, create a new conda environment using the envronment.yml file in this directory. The instructions to do that are [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

Once that's done you'll just need to activate that environment by following [these instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment).

## Load up Jupyter Notebooks and Run the Notebook

In the terminal in which you've activated your TuneThoseGains environment, you can run Jupyter by entering:

```
jupyter notebook
```
